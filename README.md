# PS3GamePadV1

So, yeah---I'm not a huge fan of this script, namely due to the "event" number of the USB always moving. I end up having to edit this script with every boot just to relocate the USB gamepad that never moved in the first place.

This script worked for the sake of testing the tank motors. However, I'm working on something friendlier with pygame libs
